        <p>A direct follow-up to Heretics of Dune, the novel chronicles the continued 
        struggles of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood against the violent Honored Matres, who 
        are succeeding in their bid to seize control of the universe and destroy the 
        factions and planets that oppose them.
