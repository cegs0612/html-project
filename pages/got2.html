    <img src="../images/got2.jpg" alt="A Clash of Kings book cover">
    <p>From the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shore of Winterfell, chao reigns as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims.As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky - a comet the colour of blood and flame - five factions struggle for control of a divided land. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of gloryis measured in blood.
