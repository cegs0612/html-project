        <img src="../images/got2.jpg" alt="A Clash of Kings book cover">
        <p>From the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shore of Winterfell,
        chao reigns as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to 
        stake their claims.As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky - a comet the colour 
        of blood and flame - five factions struggle for control of a divided land. 
        Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of 
        gloryis measured in blood.
