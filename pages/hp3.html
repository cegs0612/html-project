        <p>For Harry Potter, it's the start of another far-from-ordinary year at Hogwarts
        when the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and comes to an abrupt halt in 
        front of him. It turns out that Sirius Black, mass-murderer and follower of Lord 
        Voldemort, has escaped and they say he is coming after Harry.
        </p>
        <p>In his first Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in 
        Harry's tea leaves. And perhaps most frightening of all are the Dementors 
        patrolling the school grounds with their soul-sucking kiss in search of fresh 
        victims.
