        <h1>A Feast for Crows</h1>
        <img src="../images/got4.jpg" alt="A Feast for Crows book cover">
        <p>Few books have captivated the imagination and won the devotion and praise of 
        readers and critics everywhere as has George R. R. Martin's monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited 
        fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last 
        on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course 
        of destruction.
        </p>
        <p>It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal 
        treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an 
        uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King 
        Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King's Landing. Robb Stark's demise has 
        broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout 
        the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once 
        desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or 
        too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so 
        long, has burned itself out.
        </p>
        <p>But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the
        survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over 
        the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in 
        the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring 
        new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some 
        familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight 
        of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead.
        </p>
        <p>It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will 
        acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible 
        times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and 
        sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and 
        their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guests—but only a few are the 
        survivors.
