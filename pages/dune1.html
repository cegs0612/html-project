        <h1>Dune</h1>
        <img src="../images/dune1.jpg" alt="Dune book cover">
        <p>Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides,
        heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only 
        thing of value is the "spice" melange, a drug capable of extending life and 
        enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize 
        worth killing for...
        </p>
        <p>When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul's family will set the 
        boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as 
        he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib, he will bring to fruition 
        humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.
        </p>
        <p>A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics,
        Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of 
        what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.      
        </p>
        <p>Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a strange man bursts in with some important 
        news: Harry Potter is a wizard and has been awarded a place to study at Hogwarts. 
        And so the first of the Harry Potter adventures is set to begin.
